# Getting started

In the future, I might add an automated build to this repo, so that decoders can be
downloaded as DLLs.

For now you should follow the instructions at
[the decoders repo by LabNation](https://github.com/labnation/decoders)
to get the decoder(s) you want to use compiled and to load them into SmartScope.
